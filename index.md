__Chingu Cohort__, Voyage 09

- Took part in Chingu Cohort Voyage 9, as a FrontEnd Dev in a 2-people team. We built an original web app, that uses Web Speech API to transcribe audio captured by the device's mic (phone/desktop) and gives the option to share that text via social media. We used ReactJS framework to build the app. [Live Demo](https://chingu-v9-geckos-04.netlify.com/) [Code](https://github.com/pablowbk/v9-geckos-team-04)

__Chingu Cohort__, Voyage 08
